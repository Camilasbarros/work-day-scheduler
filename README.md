## Description

Work Day Scheduler is a simple calendar application that allows users to add and manage important events for each hour of the day. The app runs in the browser and is powered by jQuery and the Day.js library for date and time manipulation. It dynamically updates the HTML and CSS to display current time blocks, color-coded based on past, present, and future time slots.

## User Story

As a student or employee with a busy schedule, I want to add important events or even my daily activities to a daily planner so that I can manage my time effectively.

## Features

- Displays the current day at the top of the calendar when the user opens the planner.
- Presents time blocks for standard business hours (9 AM to 11 PM) when the user scrolls down.
- Color-codes each time block based on whether it is in the past, present, or future.
- Allows users to enter events by clicking on the desired time block.
- Saves the event in local storage when the user clicks the save button in that time block.
- Persists events between page refreshes.
